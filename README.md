# Analysis of Factors Correlated to Gross Earnings of Movies
This project aims to identify factors that correlate with the gross earnings of movies using Python. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and regression analysis using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The insights gained from this project can inform decision-making in the film industry.

The hypothesis I would like to test is that the following three factors would have a high correlation with gross earnings:

* Budget has a high correlation with gross earnings
* Company has a high correlation with gross earnings
* Genre has a high correlation with gross earnings

# First Findings 
Based on the initial findings from the correlation matrix analysis, it appears that the hypothesis regarding the correlation between budget and gross earnings holds true with a strong correlation coefficient of 0.74. Additionally, it was found that votes also have a moderate correlation with gross earnings with a correlation coefficient of 0.61. This suggests that the amount of money invested in a movie and the number of votes it receives can significantly impact its gross earnings. However, 

# Second Findings 
Based on the correlation matrix, the analysis showed that there is a strong positive correlation between gross earnings and writer (0.78), director (0.69), and company (0.64) factors. The year factor was excluded from the analysis as inflation would significantly affect the results. Further analysis of these factors may provide valuable insights for decision-making in the film industry.
